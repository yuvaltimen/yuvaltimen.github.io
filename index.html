        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p id="p-1">
            I'm Backend Engineer who focuses on Data Engineering, AI, System Design, and DevOps.
        </p>
        <p id="p-2">
            My interest in computers first started while I was taking a course on Mathematical
            Cryptography during my undergraduate studies. We were given an assignment which involved
            running the binary computations for the entire 10 rounds of the AES encryption
            algorithm. I remember chugging through about 12 pages of notebook paper, tediously
            writing out the 1's and the 0's, doing the binary addition, my head swirling with
            digits, and worrying that I had missed a single carry operation which would render
            my 3 days of work useless. It was then that the first time I'd ever had the thought:
            <b>"There's gotta be a way to automate this."</b> That one thought was the beginning of my career.
        </p>
        <p id="p-3">
            My first job straight out of college was as a Backend Engineer for Gryphon.ai, a
            Sales Technology company based in Boston. Here, I worked with Google's Dialogflow module,
            as well as our Java Websocket application and Kafka, in order to integrate realtime capabilities
            into sales calls through Zoom. I worked with our machine learning team to improve model accuracy,
            reduce training time, and implement an active learning pipeline for constant retraining.
        </p>
        <p id="p-4">
            Then I moved to KAYAK, where I worked as a Data Engineer. Here, I developed and optimized large-scale
            data pipelines, designed, deployed and documented API's, and implemented a few AI/ML solutions. I wrote
            algorithms for geospatial lookup, implemented geospatial indices for efficient radius lookups, and
            <b>improved our production indexing time by >96%</b>. I've worked with a variety of ETL tools, databases
            (both relational and NoSQL), frameworks, languages, build tools, and more.
